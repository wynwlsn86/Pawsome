                Pawsome Pet Adoptions" is based on Long Island, NY. Its purpose is to find
animal-loving, helpful, caring, and responsible fosters, adopters, friends,
and forever homes for all pets in need.
                </h4>
                <h4>
We stem from an up and coming rescue "Pawsome Animal Rescue" and we understand the desperate need to share each
animal, their story, and give them the exposure they need to find the right
family.
                </h4>
                <h4>
 Our goals are advocacy, outreach, education, rescue, and adoptions
for ANY and ALL animals in need. We help people with pets and all animals in
tough situations.
                </h4>
                <h4>
Please post, cross post and share, if we all do our part
we can be the voice that they don't have and help them find their happily
ever afters.
